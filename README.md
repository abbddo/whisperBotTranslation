🤔 how can I send whisper to someone who doesn't have username?

💡 you can use the user Id instad of username and the user Id works with all users even if he have username

🤔 ok what is the user Id?

💡 user Id is a unique nubmber and every user in telegram has his own user Id

🤔 how can I get the user Id to use it in this bot?

💡 simply forward any message from the user that you want to send whisper to him and I'll give you the user Id

🤔 ok now I have the user Id how can I whisper that username

💡 its very simple, you only need to put the user Id at the end of your inline query as shown in this example

\`@nnbbot hello 12345678\`

the number which is at the end of the query represent's the user Id

if you still have problem click at the Button below.`

🌐 I'm the Whisper Bot.

💬 You can use me to send secret whispers in groups.

🔮 I work in Inline mode that means you can use me even if I'm not in the group.

💌 It is very easy to use me, simply forward a message from a user to which you want to send a whisper and I'll do the rest for you.

There are other ways to use me too. If you are interested to learn more about me click on the Button below.

		,howToUse: `
the other way to use me is to write the inline query by your self

the format should be in this arrangement

\`@nnbbot your whisper @username\`

now I'll split out the format in 3 parts and explane every part of it

1- \`@nnbbot\`
this is my username it *should* be at the beginning of the inline query so I'll know that you are using me and not other bot.

2-\`your whisper\`
it is the whisper that will be sent to the target user, you need to remove \`your whisper\` and insert your actual whisper.

3- \`@username\`
you should replace this with target's username so the bot will know that the user with this username can see your \`whisper message\`.

example:- 
\`@nnbbot hello this is a test @abdood\`

📎 the bot works in groups and the target user should be in the same group with you
what you are waiting for?!
try me now 😉
